# CS-GO, Data Mining project
## Teodoro Sullazzo, Filippo Andrea Folino
<br>
This is a university project carried out together with my colleague Filippo Andrea Folino for our Data Mining course. <br>
The project focused on a binary classification task (related to CS-GO), which team will win?.<br>
The project includes the various phases of the CRISP-DM methodology:

* Business Understanding
* Data understanding
* Data preprocessing
* Modeling
* Model evaluation

Different models have been considered: 
* decision trees
* naive bayes classifiers
* KNN
* artificial neural networks
* etc ... 

Great attention was given to the model's tuning
